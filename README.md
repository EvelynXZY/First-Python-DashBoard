This is a template for a repository where you will keep all of your work for our programming assignments throughout the semester, instead of having repositories for each assignment. 

Find more details in the documents contained in the `docs/` folder:

1. [Our git workflow](./docs/git.md)
2. [Homework assignments](./docs/instructions/)
